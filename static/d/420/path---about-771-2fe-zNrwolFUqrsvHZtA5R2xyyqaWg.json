At SDSU, my research with Eric L. Sandquist focused on investigating the age of the old open cluster, NGC 6819.</p>\n<p>I also worked for Astronomical Research Cameras, assembling controllers and multiplexors for the Visible Integral Field Replicable Unit Spectrographs (VIRUS) used by the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment project at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>\n<p>During the Bridge to the Ph.D. Program, I worked with Marcel A. Ag√ºeros on the young open cluster, Alpha Persei. The new rotation periods that I measured for stars in this cluster would be used to calibrate and anchor the relationship between stellar age and rotation.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of the Bridge to the Ph.D. Program, I moved to California and was pursuing an M.S. in astronomy at SDSU. I was working with Robert W. Quimby, Director of the Mount Laguna Observatory, to classify spectra (usually supernovae) taken with the 60-inch telescope at Palomar Mountain.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I took a leave of absence from SDSU and put my thesis project on hold to help my wife immigrate to the United States. I plan to finish my graduate studies at some point in the future when the opportunity arises. For now, I am pursuing a career in data science, data enigineering, data analysis, or software enigineering.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"About Me","root":"/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
